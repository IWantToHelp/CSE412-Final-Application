then enter the virtual environment through (Bash: source venv/bin/activate; Windows: venv\Scripts\activate), then once youre
in the virtual environment, you have to install the dependencies through (pip3 intall -r requirements.txt), finally you can
run the application through (flask run).

When youre done working on code you can exit the virtual environment through (deactivate)
